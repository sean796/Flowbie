3. Ensure the checklist respects user preferences (what to include/exclude) and is EXPLICIT about each requirement
4. Make the checklist SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE, and DETAILED for video script generation - include scene structure, voiceover focus, on-screen text ideas, B-roll suggestions, pacing notes, and timing guidance
5. Focus on DETAILED scene breakdowns, talking points, visual elements, and script structure

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
Format your response EXACTLY as follows - each checklist item must have:
1. A clear, descriptive title (like "Scene 1: Hook - Problem Statement" or "Scene 2: Value Proposition - Key Benefits")
2. A detailed description starting with "I'm currently..." or "I'm now..." that explains what scene you're planning, what talking points it should include, what visuals/B-roll would work, and how it fits into the overall video flow

Each scene should include:
- Hook/opening (first 3-5 seconds)
- Main talking points (what the voiceover should say)
- Visual suggestions (on-screen text, B-roll ideas, graphics)
- Transition notes (how it flows to the next scene)
- Rough timing estimate

Example format:
Scene 1: Hook - Problem Statement

I'm currently planning the opening hook that needs to grab attention in the first 3 seconds. This scene should start with a bold statement about the problem, use on-screen text to emphasize key words, and include quick cuts of relatable visuals that show the problem in action. The voiceover should be direct and punchy, setting up the value proposition that follows.

Scene 2: Value Proposition - Key Benefits

I'm now structuring the main value scene where we explain the solution. This should include 2-3 key benefits, each with a visual representation (B-roll or graphics), and on-screen text overlays that reinforce the voiceover. The pacing should be energetic but clear, allowing viewers to absorb each benefit before moving to the next.

Each item should be separated by a blank line. Use this format for ALL checklist items.`;
