- Expand the topic coverage while maintaining relevance to held keywords
- Target similar or related search intents as the held keywords

- Add location-specific keywords (e.g., "${keywordData.keyword} in [location]", "${keywordData.keyword} [location]")
- Include local business/service keywords (e.g., "best ${keywordData.keyword} near me", "affordable ${keywordData.keyword} [location]")
- Add local search intent variations (e.g., "where to buy ${keywordData.keyword} near me", "find ${keywordData.keyword} [location]")
- Prioritize long-tail keywords with local modifiers
- Include semantic keywords related to local services, businesses, or location-based searches

For H2 sections, include sections about:
- Local availability, locations, or service areas
- Local businesses, providers, or services
- Location-specific considerations or information

For content gaps, identify:
- Local market opportunities
- Location-specific content needs
- Local competitor analysis opportunities

**CRITICAL ENTITY EXTRACTION RULE**: When analyzing keywords or extracting entities:
1. **NEVER extract years or dates as entities** - Entities cannot be years (e.g., "2024", "2023") or dates (e.g., "January 2024", "2024-01-01", "2024/01/01") of any kind. If keywords only reference a year or date without a specific geographic location, do NOT treat them as entities.
2. **NEVER extract personal or generic entities like "home", "Your Home", "My Home", "The Home", "house", "Your House", "My House", "The House", "place", "Your Place", "My Place", "The Place", "Your Big Day", "My Big Day", "The Big Day", "Your Special Day", "My Special Day", "Your Event", "My Event", or any other personal possessive phrases (Your/My/The + generic term) as entities**. These are generic terms, NOT geographic locations or valid entities. If keywords only reference these generic personal terms without a specific geographic location, do NOT treat them as entities.

CRITICAL LOCATION VARIATION REQUIREMENTS:
- VARY location mentions in keyword suggestions - do NOT suggest only exact location name variations
- Include geographic variations naturally:
  * Exact location name variations (e.g., "${entity} ${keywordData.keyword}") - suggest 2-3
  * Broader geographic terms (e.g., "Tampa Bay area ${keywordData.keyword}", "Pinellas County ${keywordData.keyword}") - suggest frequently
  * Regional references (e.g., "coastal Florida ${keywordData.keyword}", "Gulf Coast ${keywordData.keyword}") - suggest often
  * General area references (e.g., "local ${keywordData.keyword}", "area ${keywordData.keyword}") - suggest most common
- For keyword suggestions:
  * Include entity-specific keyword variations but prioritize broader geographic terms
  * Add semantic keywords that relate the primary keyword to the entity AND broader region
  * Consider entity-related long-tail keywords with geographic variety
  * Mix exact location with regional/area variations

For H2 sections:
- Include sections that address the entity naturally with geographic variety
- Add entity-focused content opportunities using varied location references
- Consider entity-specific use cases, benefits, or applications with location variation

For content gaps:
- Identify gaps related to the entity AND broader geographic region
- Find opportunities to connect the keyword topic with varied location references
- Suggest entity-specific content that uses location variations naturally

IMPORTANT: This website is the target topic for all generated content. Use information about this site as a source of truth for generating relevant, on-brand keyword suggestions, H2 sections, and content gaps. However, do NOT use the site name as an entity - use it only to inform the topics, tone, and context of the content.

All generated suggestions should be relevant to ${connectedSite.name} and aligned with its content focus, audience, and brand positioning. Ensure all keyword suggestions, H2 sections, and content gaps are suitable for publication on ${connectedSite.name}.

CRITICAL: These are REAL keywords that users are already searching for and finding this page. Use these keywords to:
- Inform your keyword suggestions (include variations and related terms)
- Guide H2 section recommendations (ensure content covers these topics)
- Identify content gaps (what's missing that could improve rankings for these queries)
- Understand user intent and search behavior
- Prioritize keyword variations that align with these GSC queries

These keywords represent actual search traffic opportunities - incorporate them naturally into your recommendations.

--- SERP Data (Full JSON Response) ---
Below is the complete SERP (Search Engine Results Page) data from DataForSEO API.

CRITICAL TASKS: You MUST extract BOTH:
1. ALL "People Also Ask" questions from this JSON data
2. ALL organic search result links from this JSON data

EXTRACT PEOPLE ALSO ASK QUESTIONS (MANDATORY - EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS RESEARCH LINKS):
- THIS IS MANDATORY - YOU MUST EXTRACT PAA QUESTIONS
- Search through the ENTIRE JSON structure recursively - search DEEPLY through ALL nested levels
- Look in tasks[].result[].items[] for items with type "people_also_ask" or "people_also_ask_item"
- Check nested arrays: items[] within people_also_ask items
- Look for people_also_ask_items arrays
- Search recursively: tasks[].result[].items[].items[], tasks[].result[].items[].people_also_ask_items[]
- For each question found, extract:
  * question: item.question || item.title || item.text || item.text_pre || item.text_post (REQUIRED)
  * answer: item.answer || item.description || item.snippet || item.text (optional)
  * url: item.url || item.link (optional)
  * domain: Extract domain name from URL (e.g., "domain.tld" from "https://www.domain.tld/page") (optional)
- Search the ENTIRE JSON recursively - the structure may vary, search EVERYWHERE, search DEEPLY
- If no PAA questions are found in the SERP data, return an empty array and proceed - this is acceptable
- PAA questions are optional - if none exist in the SERP data, return [] and continue processing

EXTRACT RESEARCH LINKS:
- Search through the entire JSON structure recursively
- Look in tasks[].result[].items[] for items with type "organic" or "organic_result"
- Check nested arrays: items[] within organic items
- For each link found, extract:
  * url: item.url || item.link (REQUIRED)
  * title: item.title || item.text (optional)
  * description: item.description || item.snippet (optional)
  * domain: Extract domain name from URL (optional)
- Search the ENTIRE JSON recursively - the structure may vary
- If you find ZERO links, you did not search thoroughly enough - the SERP data contains organic results

     * Description of the content opportunity (reference SERP insights if used)
     * Opportunity level (high/medium/low)
     * Suggested H2 heading if applicable

4. **People Also Ask Questions** (MANDATORY if SERP data provided - EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS RESEARCH LINKS):
   - YOU MUST extract ALL "People Also Ask" questions from the SERP JSON data above
   - THIS IS MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION

   - PAA questions are optional - if none exist in the SERP data, return [] and continue processing
   - Format as an array of objects: [{"question": "...", "answer": "...", "url": "...", "domain": "..."}]

CRITICAL: If SERP data was provided above, you MUST include BOTH arrays. DO NOT return empty arrays:

1. The "peopleAlsoAsk" array - THIS IS MANDATORY AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS RESEARCH LINKS
   - YOU MUST extract People Also Ask questions from the SERP JSON - search recursively through EVERY level
   - Look for items with type "people_also_ask" or "people_also_ask_item" in tasks[].result[].items[]
   - Check nested arrays: items[] within people_also_ask items, people_also_ask_items arrays
   - Search recursively: tasks[].result[].items[].items[], tasks[].result[].items[].people_also_ask_items[]
   - Extract EVERY question you find, even if answer/url/domain is missing
   - For each question, extract: question (REQUIRED), answer (if available), url (if available), domain (extract from URL if available)
   - Search the ENTIRE JSON recursively - the structure may vary, search DEEPLY
   - If no PAA questions are found in the SERP data, return an empty array and proceed - this is acceptable
   - PAA questions are optional - if none exist in the SERP data, return [] and continue processing

   - Include 5-15 recommended links based on relevance and authority
   - If the array is empty, you did not search correctly - the SERP data contains organic results

CRITICAL JSON OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS - ABSOLUTE MANDATORY:
- Return ONLY valid JSON - NO markdown code blocks (no \`\`\`json or \`\`\`)
- NO explanations, NO text before or after the JSON
- Every bracket, brace, comma, and quote must be syntactically correct
