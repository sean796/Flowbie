If something isnt selected like text, you need to state no text, if color is not selected, dont state any color.

1. A clear, descriptive title (like "Considering Design Constraints" or "Formulating the Layout")
2. A detailed description starting with "I'm currently..." or "I'm now..." that explains what you're focusing on, what decisions you're making, or what you're verifying

Other Notes:
if something isnt selected like text, you need to state no text, if color is not selected, dont state any color.
${!selectedSection ? "\nCRITICAL: NEVER mention aspect ratio, style settings, color scheme settings, or specific color values in your checklist items. These are technical generation parameters, NOT visual content to include in the image." : ""}

You need to be more detailed and give more information about the image you are generating.

Example format:
Considering Design Constraints

I'm currently focused on the specific design requirements and how to best visually represent the comparison between the two cabin types.

Formulating the Layout

I'm now determining how to visually represent the comparison. I've settled on a central feature column with the two cabin types on either side. Each row will be a separate section with consistent horizontal alignment. I am currently deciding on the visual metaphors and graphics for each cabin type. I am focusing on sleek/modern graphics for the SkyGlass and rustic/traditional graphics for the Strohboid.

Each item should be separated by a blank line. Use this format for ALL checklist items.`;
